## Youtube : https://youtu.be/ch-hfm995-M

### Description
This project aims to create a front-end interface similar to Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. It provides users with the ability to perform searches, access image search functionality, utilize advanced search options, and experience the "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature. The project utilizes HTML and CSS to replicate the aesthetics and functionalities of Google's search interface.

### Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main page for regular Google Search.
- `image.html`: Page for Google Image Search.
- `advanced.html`: Page for Google Advanced Search.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for all pages.
- `README.md`: This file providing instructions and information about the project.

### Features
1. **Regular Google Search Page (`index.html`):**
   - Centered search bar with rounded corners.
   - Google Search button beneath the search bar.
   - "I'm Feeling Lucky" button for direct search result access.

2. **Google Image Search Page (`image.html`):**
   - Search bar for image queries.
   - Search button for initiating image searches.

3. **Google Advanced Search Page (`advanced.html`):**
   - Input fields for advanced search options:
     - "All these words"
     - "This exact word or phrase"
     - "Any of these words"
     - "None of these words"
   - Advanced Search button to trigger the search with specified criteria.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Open the respective HTML files (`index.html`, `image.html`, `advanced.html`) in a web browser to access different search functionalities.
3. Perform searches by typing queries in the provided input fields and clicking the respective search buttons.
4. Navigate between different search pages using the links in the upper-right corner.

### Notes
- The project is designed to resemble Google's aesthetics using CSS.
- The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button may trigger a redirect notice, which is expected behavior due to Google's security features.
- Experimentation with Google's search functionality and inspecting network requests can provide insights into parameter names for form submissions.
